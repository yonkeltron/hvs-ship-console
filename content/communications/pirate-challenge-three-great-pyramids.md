We are pirates.
Lower your shields and surrender your ships.
Your cargo and riches will be added to our own.
Oh wait, you don't have shields and there's only one of you.
This won't end well for you as you're likely outgunned by the Three Great Pyramids and certainly no match for our ace pilot!

You can pick the easy route or the hard route.
Either way, we're getting your cargo!

Greedily,

Mickey O'Rigid, Pirate Captain
