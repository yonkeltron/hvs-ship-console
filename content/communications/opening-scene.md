If you are reading this, then I’m already dead. My plan was to transport the other message cylinder to the TGB branch in Akira before it’s too late but it looks like that didn’t work out. After suffering a malfunction, the crew and I were easy prey for a pirate attack. They were either captured immediately or killed in the fighting. We were outnumbered 3-to-1.

Since I don’t stand a chance in a fight against pirates, a few of the engineers locked us in the shuttle bay to make a last stand. We can’t hold out much longer, we set this shuttle to autopilot when our wreck encounters a ship. You have to get the equations to the economists in Akira before The Sedition deduces enough from the evidence to destabilize the markets. The price of cottage cheese could skyrocket. Billions will suffer.

Take what few resources we could rescue and go. Before it’s too late.

P.S. It's your money, use it when you need it.
