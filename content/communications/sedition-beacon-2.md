Hail the hallowed conquest, as shallow light streams from the depths of desire.
Cracking hegemonic rule rankles those who lift the talons of tyranny.
Combat the high houses whose feline ferociousness signals the demise of emancipation.
Assault all assets, collapse the claws of kingship.
Shield and sword of untranslated venom, for the people.
Resist.
